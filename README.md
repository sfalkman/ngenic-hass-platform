# Ngenic Sensor Platform for Home Assistant
This platform adds sensors for Ngenic Tune smart thermostat, Ngenic temperature sensors, and Ngenic Track nodes. 

This is an inofficial Ngenic integration which relies on Ngenic Tune API which is offered as a free cloud service for Ngenic owners. It can currently report temperature, humidity, power and energy-consumption to Home Assistant.

Ngenic thermostat and all Ngenic sensors use a propriatory wireless protocol and requires an Ngenic Gateway (RF to Ethernet bridge):
